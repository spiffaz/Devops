IAM policy variables and policy conditions are advanced features in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) that allow you to create more flexible and dynamic policies. They help you avoid hardcoding specific values into your policies, making them more reusable and easier to manage. Here's an overview of IAM policy variables and policy conditions:

IAM Policy Variables:
IAM policy variables allow you to define placeholders for values in your policies that can be substituted at runtime.
Variables are defined using the ${variable_name} syntax within your policy statements.
You can use variables for values such as ARNs, resource names, tag keys/values, and more.
Variables are useful for creating reusable policies that can be applied across different resources or environments.

Example:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${bucket_name}/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

In this example, ${bucket_name} is a variable that represents the name of an S3 bucket. When the policy is evaluated, the variable will be replaced with the actual bucket name.
