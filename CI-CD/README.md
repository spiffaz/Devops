# CI-CD Pipelines: From Manual Setup to Production Ready Automation

Welcome to the CI-CD Pipelines repository! This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of creating production-ready Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI-CD) pipelines, starting from the basics and gradually building a fully functional pipeline. 

## Philosophy Behind the Process

At the core of this tutorial is the belief in understanding the manual processes before automation. We'll guide you through each step, demonstrating how tasks are performed manually, and then automate them, ensuring you grasp the fundamentals before diving into the automated world of CI-CD pipelines.
