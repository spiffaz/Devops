Simple pipeline

1)   Login to the Jenkins application.
2)   Create new job
3)   Name the job and select Maven project as the project type
4)   Select git as the source of our code. I used this repository - ``` https://github.com/ValaxyTech/hello-world.git ``` for this demo.
5)   Put in ``` clean install package ``` in the goals in the build devtion
