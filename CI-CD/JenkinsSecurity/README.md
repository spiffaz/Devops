Tips for securing Jenkins

1)   Always change default admin password.
2)   Create users to perform tasks. Do not operate with the admin account.
3)   Delete or remove the default password file from the server after use.
4)   Enable security under the "configure global security" menu.
5)   Install a plugin for role based user access. This is the best to ensure users can only access what they need to.
6)   If SSH is enabled, configure it on a port different from the default (22).
